00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.353
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.820
<v ->Another common thing that we do in JavaScript</v>

3
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.680
is adding and removing of classes,

4
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.770
and it's a little bit different

5
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.363
than just using properties like we've used so far.

6
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.490
Let's dive into how this all works.

7
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.093
I'm actually just gonna comment out,

8
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.130
let's comment out everything, right?

9
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.090
Let's start fresh.

10
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.530
We'll go down here, and we'll says classes.

11
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.270
So when you select an element,

12
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.830
there is a class list attribute on that,

13
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.670
and on that there are some methods

14
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.520
for getting all of the classes

15
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.400
as well as adding and removing multiple classes.

16
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.500
Let's go and find, let's do something fun,

17
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.880
maybe we'll do some animation.

18
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.393
So let's grab this image here.

19
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.890
Let's create a brand new image.

20
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.160
Copy one of these images, go up here,

21
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.470
if it's not already there,

22
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.676
and give yourself a nice big 600-pixel image.

23
00:00:56.676 --> 00:00:57.940
(whistles)

24
00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.290
Nice rocks.

25
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.290
Let's go ahead and give that a class of nice.

26
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.300
We'll go ahead and select it,

27
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.203
so const pic is equal to, I have a little qs,

28
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.050
document.querySelector,

29
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.510
we will grab the image of the class of nice

30
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.897
and console.log the pic.classlist.

31
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.780
Now if we open up our dev tools here,

32
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.640
you'll see that we get this thing,

33
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.560
which is a DOMTokenList, it's kind of like an array

34
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.600
of all of the classes that are on that image.

35
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.453
Now if we go ahead and add another, nice and cool,

36
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.040
you'll see we get both of them.

37
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.420
And it will also give us a value of all of the classes

38
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.660
on there.

39
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.350
So that's pretty cool because we can be able to add them.

40
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.520
However, if you look in the prototype.

41
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.880
We haven't learned what the prototype is just yet,

42
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.210
but if you sneak into the prototype,

43
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.240
you're often able to see what are the methods

44
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.410
that you're able to call against the thing that we have.

45
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.680
So classList has a prototype,

46
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.680
and in that there's all kinds, adds, contains, entries,

47
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.510
forEach, items, keys, a lot of these are...

48
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.780
A lot of these are methods for working with the classes,

49
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.590
so it's exactly what we're gonna do here.

50
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.530
So what we can do is take that pic.classList

51
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.510
and we can run .add, you see actually,

52
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.260
even my VS code is giving me commonly used ones,

53
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.170
like these little stars.

54
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.640
These are ones that I use a lot in my own coding.

55
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.560
Add, remove, contains, and toggle,

56
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.980
so add, if I want to add a class of dog.

57
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.023
Or maybe we'll say open.

58
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.270
And then when I run the code and inspect that,

59
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.890
you see that it's there.

60
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.890
Maybe you can also remove a class of cool.

61
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.093
Now when we run it you see it's gone.

62
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.870
There is toggle, which is pretty cool.

63
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.820
Let's actually write a little bit of CSS

64
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.935
so we can visually see what's going on here.

65
00:03:36.935 --> 00:03:40.820
Let's go just to here, and we've got a style tag.

66
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.210
If not, just give yourself a style tag

67
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.910
somewhere on the page.

68
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.700
Let's just give ourselves a class of round,

69
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.283
and we'll say border-radius 50%.

70
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.530
Then what we'll do is we will add a class

71
00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.780
of round, so pic.classList.add('round').

72
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.530
Now when we refresh it's obviously got a class of round.

73
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.280
The kind of cool thing about that

74
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.740
is that we can add and remove that class

75
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.580
either by pasting into the console

76
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.570
or we can do it on click.

77
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.240
Let's show you both.

78
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.440
Let's say classList.toggle,

79
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.950
that will add it if it's not there

80
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.720
and remove it if it is there.

81
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.340
So look at that, beautiful.

82
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.280
And we can just copy that and paste it into our console.

83
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.720
You'll see that it adds and removes it.

84
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.670
If we go into our CSS and we add a transition,

85
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.270
all 0.2 seconds, what that will do,

86
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.620
is every time we run it, it should...

87
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.910
oh, you know what, it's only animating itself

88
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.240
when it has the class.

89
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.850
So maybe we will grab our image

90
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.590
and add the transition on the image,

91
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.350
not the class of round.

92
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.563
Now when you sort of toggle that.

93
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.160
Now when you toggle that, you'll see that it's pretty cool

94
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.470
where it adds and removes it.

95
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.730
The kind of cool thing about that is

96
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.530
we're gonna learn about events really quickly.

97
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.830
We can peek ahead real quick.

98
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.630
We can say the pic.addEventListener,

99
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.460
and then we're going to listen for a click.

100
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.283
And when that happens, we can run a function.

101
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.030
Actually, maybe we'll make a function out here

102
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.413
called toggleRound, and all that will do

103
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.420
is it will toggle the class of round,

104
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.820
and then here we can pass a reference to that function.

105
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.210
Again, we haven't learned this yet,

106
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.200
but stay with me.

107
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.230
I think we can understand what's going on here.

108
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.211
We make a function called toggleRound

109
00:05:55.211 --> 00:05:57.700
that will toggle the classList here,

110
00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.690
and then we will just every time we click it,

111
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.083
we will run that function.

112
00:06:03.491 --> 00:06:05.850
(transformation whistles)

113
00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.490
You have to make the sounds yourself,

114
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.970
and it's pretty cool because now

115
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.110
we can just go on this round

116
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.597
and say things like transform: rotate(20deg).

117
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.050
Whoo, and then you can go bananas with it.

118
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.300
Whoo.

119
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.710
Here maybe two...

120
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.153
Let's do 360.

121
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.930
Oh you can actually, no you can use turn.

122
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.163
One turn.

123
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.893
Oh, and we can scale it, two.

124
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.690
And maybe add a box-shadow, 0 0 10px black.

125
00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.270
You get the point, right?

126
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.270
It's pretty cool that a lot of JavaScript interaction

127
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.390
is simply just going to be adding and removing classes

128
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.180
at different points in time.

129
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.410
And that will allow us to then step in with CSS

130
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.490
and add and remove all these different transitions

131
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.010
that we have.

132
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:22.640
That's pretty common with things like modals or navs

133
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.010
that need to open and close or slide in from the side,

134
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.410
and we'll be doing quite a bit of that in this class.

135
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.250
But just know that we've got this classList here,

136
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.220
and we've got add, remove, toggle,

137
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.880
and then also has contains,

138
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.830
which I don't use all that often, but we could.

139
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.573
So we just take the pic.classLIst.contains,

140
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.490
is it currently open?

141
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:45.880
True.

142
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.713
I click it.

143
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.960
True, oh no, it's round, that's what we're looking for.

144
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.860
Round, true, click it again, it should return false to us.

145
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.560
So that will be helpful in situations

146
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.780
if you need to know if something is currently open,

147
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.330
or if there's a specific state that you're saving

148
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.600
in the classList.

149
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.720
So that is adding and removing classes.

150
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.690
In the next video we're going

151
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.210
to go into just regular attributes.

152
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:15.560
Even though classList is an attribute,

153
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.060
so we could say pic.className,

154
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.610
that will actually just give us a list of the classes.

155
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.350
That's just a property on the element called className.

156
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.820
However, classList gives us some sort of utility functions

157
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.950
or utility methods for working with it.

158
00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.790
Anytime that you want to work with classes,

159
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:39.120
and I always reach for classList.

160
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.410
It's somewhat new, a couple years old in the browser.

161
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:44.610
That's just why that one is existing there.

162
00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:46.760
So with that, I'll see you in the next one.
